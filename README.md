# Personal portfolio
Small website to showcase my basic information, experiences and projects. This project was build with [Astro]((https://astro.build)) using the [Aria Template](https://github.com/ccbikai/astro-aria) as a start point.

## Aria Template

This is a personal blog, portfolio, or blog template created for Astro, by [Ccbikai](https://github.com/ccbikai).

You can install this theme with the Astro command like so:

```js
npm create astro@latest -- --template ccbikai/astro-aria
```
